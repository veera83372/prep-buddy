Data Preparation is the process of gathering, cleaning, and consolidating data into a form suitable for further analysis and processing.
Its estimated that the preparation phase alone accounts for about 60%-80% of the overall time spent in any data mining project.
Data preparation vastly improves the quality of data and consequently helps in improving the quality of results from analytical models.

Our aim is to build a rich data preparation library that can work at scale. Its goal is to make data preparation scalable and easy.
It consists of common preparation tasks such as De-duplication, different kinds of imputations and transformations, grouping operations,
encryption and data annonymization etc.
