A Scala / Java / Python library for cleaning, transforming and executing other preparation tasks for large datasets on Apache Spark.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Post questions and comments to the Google group, or email them directly to prep-buddy@googlegroups.com.

Docs are available at http://srihari.github.io/prep-buddy
Or check out the Scaladoc, Javadoc, or Python doc.

Our aim is to provide a set of algorithms for cleaning and transforming very large data sets, inspired by predecessors such as Open Refine, Pandas and Scikit-learn packages.
